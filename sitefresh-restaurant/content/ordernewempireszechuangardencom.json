The system messed up my address and instead of turning around they called and were patient. I forgot to ask for white rice instead of pork fried rice (I've never been a fan of it) but it was so well done, I didn't mind!\n    Jonathan\n  \n      4 reviews\n    Ordered the Sesame Chicken dinner special with pork fried rice and egg roll.  Good meal as always and a lot of food for the price.  My go to Chinese food place in Sunnyside.\n    Melissa\n  \n      Top Reviewer\n    My only complaint is that the house noodle soup did not include actual noodles, but 2 bags of those crunchy noodles most places supply as an addition.\n    Jonathan\n  \n      2 reviews\n    I love this place....it is my \"go-to\" place when I am hungry and need some good Asian food, FAST!
